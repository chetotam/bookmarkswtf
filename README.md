# bookmarkswtf 0.0

bookmarkswtf is simple online bookmarking service for pages that you once decided to save for later but never actually got to open them again. It will silently delete your bookmarks after certain time passed (like month or so) so you won't deal with all the stuff you no longer interested in. Inspired by my 291 Chrome bookmarks.
